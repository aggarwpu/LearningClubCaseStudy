### Project Information

> The project is a Exploratory Data Analytics (EDA) project that uses the lending club data set to predict whether a loan will be defaulted or not.

### Project Background

>A largest online loan marketplace company facilitates personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access >lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface. 

>Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit >loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers >who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'. 

### Project Statement

>The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are >strong indicators >of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment. 

> Find the driving factors which lead to the defaulted loans which are major source of loss for the company.

### Data Set

> The data set is a csv file providing information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not.

## Conclusions

- Major Driving factor which can be used to predict the chance of defaulting and avoiding Credit Loss:
  1. DTI
  2. Grades
  3. Verification Status
  4. Annual income
  5. Pub_rec_bankruptcies

- The case study helped to identify the key insights i.e. variables including interest rate, loan issue year etc. which can  be considered  while approving the loan applications.
